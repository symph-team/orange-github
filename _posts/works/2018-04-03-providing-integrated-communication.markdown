    <H6>[ THE PROBLEM ]</H6>
    <H3>

      The company’s email system needed to be upgraded, while the document processing and communications software were not a good fit for the company’s team-centric environment. They were also experiencing exponential growth in terms of headcount, so they needed a solution that can easily scale with their growing numbers.
    </p>
    <p>
      The company had been using Lotus Notes for their emails and an open source solution for document processing and spreadsheets. These tools were convenient for them when they were starting out as a small business. However, they were faced with challenges when they experienced exponential growth. In a span of a decade, they grew from 20 employees to 700 strong. This growth posed a challenge for their IT staff - they needed a solution to effectively manage the IT infrastructure and prepare for more staff additions in the coming years.
    </p>
    <p>
      The company realized they needed to migrate to a reliable and scalable system that can cope with the company’s growth. Along with this realization came the need to modernize the infrastructure - with the advent of mobile technology, the need for accessible, smart, and fast communication was now a requirement, rather than a good-to-have. They knew that in a team-centric working environment housed in different locations, they needed efficient collaboration tools to work seamlessly together.

      The company started to look offshore for development companies. They researched online to look for Java development companies in different countries, and gathered good feedback about Orange and Bronze from various forums. They reached out to O&B and realized that the communication issues they were initially worried about were non-existent. They were very comfortable speaking with a very articulate team, and they were confident that working with O&B would be a seamless experience.

      The company claims that this was a very different outsourcing experience from previous ones they had. The main difference was the type of developers they worked with. They realize that the O&B staff were well-qualified and competently trained. They were impressed with the skills and most importantly, the commitment of each resource to their project. They felt that the offshore team was part of their in-house team. It was an overall pleasant and productive working relationship.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most importantly, offshore resources would cost a fraction of what US resources will cost. They were able to bring down development costs to 50% by bringing the work to the Philippines.
